## Ethereum lottery react app

This project was bootstrapped with `Create React App`.
It is a basic client which interacts with the `ethereum_lottery`
smart contract which can be found at this link here: `https://github.com/StephanYu/ethereum_lottery`.
The `ethereum_lottery` contract has been deployed on the `Rinkeby test network` via the `Infura API`. 
You can find more information on `Infura` at this link here: `http://infura.io`.
